## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a lot about using images in the background. However, I know that my current knowledge is still not enough and I will continue working to improve this part.

```css
body {
    background-color: var(--cor1);
    background-image: url("images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg"), url("images/bg-pattern-top.svg");
    background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
    background-position: 45vw 50vh, right 50vw bottom 50vh; 
}
```

### Continued development

Want to learn even more about flexbox, and maybe something about grid. Further, want to know more about images in the background, since is a concept that i'm not comfortable yet.
